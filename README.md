# Sarsabz

Sarsabz is an application for maintaining your plants. It will help you to see all of your children inside a beautiful layout.

Each of your plants has a card in Sarsabz. You will find the essential information you need to keep them alive and happy on those cards.

### IR Language

Currently, I am living in Iran, so the language of this application is Persian now, but I will add English soon.

## About the developer

I am *Borzoo Moazami*, a front-end developer. 

Sarsabz is a project for me to improve several aspects of my programming skills.
